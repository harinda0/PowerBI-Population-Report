# PowerBI-Population-Report
This is my first Power BI report. I used population data converted from PDF to CSV. This project showcases data transformation and effective visualization techniques, providing insights into population trends across regions. Gained foundational skills in selecting appropriate visualizations and creating interactive dashboards.
