# Population Data Visualization Report

This report was my first hands-on project in the Visualizations and Leadership course. The dataset was derived from a PDF, successfully converted to CSV for analysis. The report provides a comprehensive visualization of population trends, allowing for insightful comparisons across different regions and time periods.

# Key features of this report include:

**Data Transformation:** Conversion from PDF to CSV and subsequent cleaning and preparation.
**Visualization Techniques:** Strategic selection of visualization types to effectively communicate the data insights.
**Interactive Dashboards:** User-friendly and interactive elements to enhance data exploration and understanding.

This project provided foundational experience in selecting the correct types of visualizations to effectively represent various data aspects.
